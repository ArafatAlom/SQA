# Log In

This HTML document represents a basic login form layout with styling and structure designed for user authentication purposes. Below is a breakdown of the document's components and functionalities:

### Document Structure:

- `<!DOCTYPE html>`: Declares the document type and version of HTML.
- `<html lang="en" dir="ltr">`: The root element of an HTML page, with attributes specifying the language (`lang="en"`) and text direction (`dir="ltr"` for left-to-right).
- `<head>`: Contains meta-information about the HTML document.
  - `<meta charset="utf-8">`: Specifies the character encoding for the document.
  - `<title> Login Form</title>`: Sets the title of the document, which appears in the browser tab.
  - `<link rel="stylesheet" href="/css/loginstyle.css">`: Links an external CSS file for styling the login form.
- `<body>`: Contains the content of the document.
  - `<div class="center">`: A container for the login form, likely styled to be centered on the page.
    - `<h1>Login</h1>`: A heading for the form.
    - `<form method="post">`: The form element with the `method="post"` attribute, indicating that the form data should be sent to the server as part of the HTTP request body.
      - `<div class="txt_field">`: A container for each input field, possibly styled for aesthetics.
        - `<input type="text" required>`: An input field for the username. The `required` attribute makes this field mandatory.
        - `<span></span>`: May be used for styling purposes or as a placeholder for validation messages.
        - `<label>Username</label>`: A text label for the username input field.
      - `<input type="password" required>`: An input field for the password, with the content obscured. Also marked as `required`.
      - `<div class="pass">Forgot Password?</div>`: A clickable text for users who have forgotten their password. However, without a link (`<a href="">`), it's purely informational.
      - `<input type="submit" value="Login">`: A submit button for the form.
      - `<div class="signup_link">`: Contains a message and a link for users to navigate to a registration page if they don't have an account.
        - `<a href="{{url('/register')}}">Sign up Here</a>`: A link to the registration page. The `{{url('/register')}}` suggests this template might be intended for use with a web framework that supports URL generation methods.

- `<script src="script.js"></script>`: Links an external JavaScript file, presumably to enhance the form with client-side interactivity.
